# RWAV for MCP (Beta)

RWAV lets your AI coding assistant control music in Roon — play albums, search, and manage what’s playing — all from your editor. This small app adds RWAV tools to any MCP‑compatible client (e.g., Roo / Cline).

## Quick Start

1) Download the latest RWAV MCP for your OS from Releases.
2) Run it:
   - macOS/Linux: double‑click or run from Terminal
   - Windows: double‑click `rwav-mcp.exe`
3) Connect your MCP client (Roo / Cline): add a server named “rwav” that runs the `rwav-mcp` command with `stdio` transport.
4) RWAV MCP looks for the RWAV Bridge automatically. If it’s not installed, you’ll get a friendly prompt with a download link.

That’s it — start asking your assistant to play music in Roon.

## What You Need

- A Roon Core on your network
- RWAV Bridge running on a machine that can reach your Core (the MCP will guide you if it’s missing)

## Privacy

RWAV runs locally by default. Your music control stays on your network.
